## Four-digit Multi-ethnic HLA v1 (2021)

The multi-ethnic HLA panel consists of 36,586 haplotypes of five global populations. We have released the panel at both two-field (four-digit) and G-group resolution.

### Multi-ethnic HLA v2 Details

**Samples:**

  - We added Japanese samples with HLA alleles called with deep target sequencing (n = 723; Hirata et al. Nat Genet. 2019).
  - Add Estonian biobank samples with IRB approval (n = 2,233; Mitt et al. Eur J Hum Genet. 2017).

**HLA alleles:**

  - We used gold-standard HLA allele calls (instead of inferred calls from whole genome sequencing) when possible.
  - We updated and recalled HLA alleles using HLA-LA (Dilthey et al. Bioinformatics. 2019) in Jackson Heart Study (n = 3,026).
  - We updated and recalled HLA alleles using HLA-LA in Estonian Biobank (n = 2,233).

**Scaffold variants:**

  - We added population-specific SNP variants which are common in one population but rare in the other populations when they are in 1KG and pass QC, by cross-cohort SNP imputation within the reference panel.
  - We removed all SNP variants that are not included in the commonly-used genotyping arrays.

**Minimac4 options:**

  - We optimized `--probThreshold`, `--diffThreshold`, `--topThreshold` parameters in minimac4. Optimized parameters are now used for all HLA panels.

**Imputation results:**

  - We output 2-digit and 4-digit-resolution HLA alleles. We do not output higher resolution HLA alleles in this version.

## CAAPA - African American Panel

  Whole genome sequences were available on 883 individuals from 19 case-control studies of asthma included in the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) and were used to summarize the genomic contributions to individuals of African ancestry.
