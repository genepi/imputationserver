# Pipeline Overview

Our pipeline performs the following steps:

## Quality Control

*  Create chunks with a size of 20 Mb
*  For each 20Mb chunk we perform the following checks:

    **On Chunk level:**

    *   Determine amount of valid variants: A variant is valid iff it is included in the reference panel. At least 3 variants must be included.
    *   Determine amount of variants found in the reference panel: At least 50 % of the variants must be be included in the reference panel.
    *   Determine sample call rate: At least 50 % of the variants must be called for each sample.  

    Chunk exclusion: if (#variants < 3 || overlap < 50% || sampleCallRate < 50%)

    **On Variant level:**

    *   Check alleles: Only A,C,G,T are allowed
    *   Calculate alternative allele frequency (AF): Mark all with a AF > 0.5.
    *   Calculate SNP call rate
    *   Calculate chi square for each variant (reference panel vs. study data)
    *   Determine allele switches: Compare ref and alt of reference panel with study data (A/T and C/G variants are ignored).
    *   Determine strand flips: After eliminating possible allele switches, flip and compare ref/alt from reference panel with study data.
    *   Determine allele switches in combination with strand flips: Combine the two rules from above.  

    Variant exclusion: Variants are excluded in case of: [a] invalid alleles occur (!(A,C,G,T)), [b] duplicates (DUP filter or (pos - 1 == pos)), [c] indels, [d] monomorphic sites, [e] allele mismatch between reference panel and study, [f] SNP call rate < 90%.

    **On Sample level:**

    *   For chr1-22, a chunk is excluded if one sample has a call rate < 50 %. Only complete chunks are excluded, not samples (see "On Chunk level" above)


* Perform a liftOver step, if build of input data and reference panel does not match (b37 vs b38).

## Phasing

* Execute for each chunk one of the following phasing algorithms (we use an overlap of 5 Mb). For example, chr20:1-20000000 and reference population EUR:

**Eagle2**
````sh
./eagle --vcfRef HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.chr20.shapeit3.mac5.aa.genotypes.bcf
--vcfTarget chunk_20_0000000001_0020000000.vcf.gz  --geneticMapFile genetic_map_chr20_combined_b37.txt
--outPrefix chunk_20_0000000001_0020000000.phased --bpStart 1 --bpEnd 25000000 --allowRefAltSwap
--vcfOutFormat z
````
    
**Please note:** Target-only sites for unphased data are not included in the final output.
    
## Imputation

###
* Execute for each chunk minimac in order to impute the phased data (we use a window of 500 kb):

````sh
./Minimac4 --refHaps HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.chr1.shapeit3.mac5.aa.genotypes.m3vcf.gz
--haps chunk_1_0000000001_0020000000.phased.vcf --start 1 --end 20000000
--window 500000 --prefix chunk_1_0000000001_0020000000 --cpus 1 --chr 20 --noPhoneHome
--format GT,DS,GP --allTypedSites --meta --minRatio 0.00001
````
If a map file is available (currently TOPMed only), the following cmd is executed:

````sh
./Minimac4 --refHaps HRC.r1-1.GRCh38.chr1.shapeit3.mac5.aa.genotypes.m3vcf.gz
--haps chunk_1_0000000001_0020000000.phased.vcf --start 1 --end 20000000
--window 500000 --prefix chunk_1_0000000001_0020000000 --cpus 1 --chr 20 --noPhoneHome
--format GT,DS,GP --allTypedSites --meta --minRatio 0.00001 --referenceEstimates --map B38_MAP_FILE.map
````

## HLA Imputation Pipeline

In addition to intergenic SNPs, HLA imputation outputs five different types of markers: (1) binary marker for classical HLA alleles; (2) binary marker for the presence/absence of a specific amino acid residue; (3) HLA intragenic SNPs, and (4) binary markers for insertion/deletions, as described in the typical output below. The goal is to minimize prior assumption on which types of variations will be causal and test all types of variations simultaneously in an unbiased fashion. However, the users are always free to restrict analyses to specific marker subsets.

!!! note
    For binary encodings, A = Absent, T = Present.


| Type   |      Format      |  Example |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Classical HLA alleles |  HLA\_[GENE]\*[ALLELE]| HLA_A\*01:02 (two-field allele) <br> HLA_A\*02 (one-field allele) |
| HLA amino acids |  AA_[GENE]\_[AMINO ACID POSITION]\_[GENOMIC POSITION]\_[EXON]\_[RESIDUE] | AA_B_97_31324201_exon3_V (amino acid position 97 in HLA-B, genomic position 31324201 (GrCh37) in exon 3, residue = V (Val) ) |
| HLA intragenic SNPs |  SNPS_[GENE]\_[GENE POSITION]\_[GENOMIC POSITION]\_[EXON/INTRON] | SNPS_C_2666_31237183_intron6 (SNP at position 2666 of the gene body, genomic position 31237183 in intron 6)|
| Insertions/deletions |  INDEL_[TYPE]\_[GENE]\_[POSITION]| INDEL_AA_C_300x301_31237792 Indel between amino acids 300 and 301 in HLA-C, at genomic position 31237792) |

<br> 
We note that our current implementation of the reference panel is limited to the G-group resolution (DNA sequences that determine the exons 2 and 3 for class I and exon 2 for class II genes), and amino acid positions outside the binding groove were taken as its best approximation. When converting G-group alleles to the two-field resolution, we first approximated G-group alleles to their corresponding allele at the four-field resolution based on the ordered allele list in the distributed IPD-IMGT/HLA database (version 3.32.0). We explicitly include exonic information in the HLA-TAPAS output.

## Compression and Encryption

* Merge all chunks of one chromosome into one single vcf.gz
* Encrypt data with one-time password

## Chromosome X Pipeline

Additionally to the standard QC, the following per-sample checks are executed for chrX:

* Ploidy Check: Verifies if all variants in the nonPAR region are either haploid or diploid.
* Mixed Genotypes Check: Verifies if the amount of mixed genotypes (e.g. 1/.) is < 10 %.

For phasing and imputation, chrX is split into three independent chunks (PAR1, nonPAR, PAR2). These splits are then automatically merged by Munich Imputation Server and are returned as one complete chromosome X file. Only Eagle is supported.
